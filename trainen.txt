Greetings to everyone who joined once the daily likes and views were confirmed.
Why do you ask? Did 25k dislikes really come?Why go and dislike this trailer?
To those at Lyca, if you thought about it, aren't you feeling ashamed?
It seems like a Hindi movie with Amitabh Bachchan.
Truly, Thalaivar has aged. Sivaji is indeed at the peak of his career!
Stop saying Head and stand aside.
Those who've seen the original version of Pink might think this trailer feels old, but all the scenes are new for newcomers.
It's on another level! All the best, Shankar sir, you're a legend.
Those who caught the H Raja reference, please like.
head, your energy is beyond compare, you're smashing it.
It won't happen, it shouldn't happen, I won't let it happen! Who expected that line?
Nerkonda Parvai continued for 5 days in all theaters, it was a blockbuster movie. Yes=Like, No=Comment.
Hey YouTube, with just one button, you're pushing your software to death.
Ultimate star Ajith Kumar,head head head.
If you're truly a fan of Thala, like this.
Thalaiva, superstar Rajinikanth, the number one mass hero.

Superstar is absolutely rocking.
I'm a big fan of Sasikumar, so I like the movie.
Superstar Rajinikanth fans, hit like. Let's get 2K likes. "Petta" this Pongal, guaranteed blockbuster.
Siruthai Siva, instead of being a director, he should be given a drum and let him bang it, bang it, and see if he can direct.
Thala, Thala speaks. Anil, Vicky, and Vijay are blessed with Thala's grace, my friend.
Why does the trailer look like a Hollywood movie? Chiyaan rocks, he's nailed it with his getup, it's on another level.
The background music is on another level, going higher, Ghibran...
However big "Bigil" trailer's views may reach, it shouldn't surpass this.
Come, superstar, come, Thalaiva, Marana mass, Thailaiva, we're eagerly waiting for the fire, Thailva.
That final dialogue... Why are you getting upset over someone's trust for another? Why are you getting jealous?
Everyone, let's hit 1M likes... Don't hold back... Create IDs... Hurry up.
Can anyone else speak and act in Tamil like Thala? Thala is the true Tamilian.
People who keep eagerly waiting for October 4, hit like.
Thalapathy fans, like for Thala to come. We're here, Thala.
Why does the trailer look like a prostitute's genital?
Why are you disliking this? The trailer has a swagger that's incomparable!
Anil Kunjunga is very scared. The only solution for this is Arali poisoning.
Those who come after listening to "Agalathey" song, like and comment.
The trailers are awesome; I'm eagerly waiting for the big-screen release.
Love you, Karthik, a true fan-made film.
Thala is on another level in "Nerkonda Paarvai".
Ajith Kumar, the human god. Ajith Kumar, the man of love. Ultimate star Ajith Kumar.
Those who watch this trailer daily...?
The trailer looks superb; the movie will be a hit in the UK.
When will Chiyaan Vikram come with mass?
The story being told with the troubles faced by women in this trailer is amazing. #Thalapathy fan.
Vijay Sethupathi Anna looks extremely mass, as always.
The final dialogue and the previous dialogue are mass.
Happy Diwali, guys! If there are Vijay fans here, enjoy your "Sarkar" day.
Like if you want, chant "Narayaaa Narayaaa Narayaaa".
Long live the valour, but the cowardice of this worthless man, Ajith, prevails.
SK Anna, you're on another level, always moving forward, Anna. Always love you, Anna.
Hit like; there's only one comment here.
You've wasted so much money; you're only showing drama on cell phones, there's nothing else.
22 hours, 10 million views, wow, Thalaiva... Now come, Chinese boys...
I am waiting for Thala in "Nerkonda Parvai"...
Rajinikanth sir's fans, like here.
Guys, we need to hit 11 million views and 800k likes by tonight... Speed up, dudes.
The hero already looks like a zero.
After a long time, it's stuck at 467k... Thala's mass isn't allowing the views to increase.
Unlike others, who wear a band and act, Karthik chooses and acts in his films. Love you, Thala. Hats off.
Trending at No. 1 in Singapore, steadily.
Father's Day Special: Watch it... Share awareness.
When this movie releases, Thalaivaaaa... I'll watch you again and again...
Why 4.3k dislikes? What do they understand? Please tell me, dislikers.
Waiting for "Kaappaan." Suriya fans, like here.
Superstar is the only Superstar, nobody else can match him.
"Asuran" - The hunt begins... I am Dhanush's fan.
Nobody can play with Superstar like "No one two."
Tell me something about the trailer, these fanboys are conducting a poll. Like for the comment, haha!
Will it get 1 million likes?
This is not just Tamil Nadu, this is our Thala Nadu!
The realistic portrayal in your combo (Vetri + Dhanush) is turning out well... Awesome!
I can't wait any longer to hear your (Vetri + Dhanush) dialogue. It's going to be awesome.
The background music is amazing. If they didn't have us, they wouldn't have the courage to compose. It's impossible to compose just for the sake of composing, Chidambaram. Superb!
I'll kick you wearing my underwear.
The atmosphere is going to heat up this Pongal.
This Diwali, it's "Bigil" for Kaidhi...
Next week, there will be 10 million views for this movie which had a disgraceful story.
Is it going to be like this? Is "Thalapathy 64" going to be like this?
It's a different kind of movie, interesting.
Why are you looking down on someone's trust for another person? Thala is on another level.
The trailer is intense. The award is a sure thing.
Rajini + Shankar + AR Rahman = another level... Let's see what this combo brings.
I have been sitting with rage, I won't let those 39k dislikes go without retribution.
WTF is Manu doing between Gandhi and Ambedkar at 1:12?
We can buy money and give it, but can we give the title "Tholapathy" just like that?!
The grand events for "Viswasam" are yet to be seen.
Those who think this movie will be a flop, hit like.
Those who watched Thalaivar's trailer more than 10 times, hit like.
OMG, 300k views in 3 minutes!
Thalaivaaaa, you're the one and only superstar! "Petta" is going to be terrific, I'll be in the FDFS at Trichy.
Vikram's look is extraordinary. It seems like they've put extra effort into the making. Looks like they've spent more money. The trailer is superbly mass.
They've rocked it! Thalaivar and team!
Thala Ajith Kumar, Yuvan Shankar Raja, H. Vinond... Uff!
Chiyan Vikram fans, hit the like button.
The background music is nice, but it's not saying much else.
Dr. BR Ambedkar's dialogue. Jai Bheem.
Like for "KGF" Chapter 1, like for "Kaithi."
It's trending at 16! OMG, wow, love Rajinikanth.
We are also eagerly waiting to see what happens. Don't talk nonsense.
GVP Kumar's music is on another level.
Chiyan, you can act fast and furious.
We need to reach 16 million views in the next 3 days, friends. Keep watching.
The boss looks amazing... Siva is fantastic.
Hey, do you need 600 crores to make this movie? Then, I won't wait for this movie to be released...
Hey, Pandey, are you going to stand outside the theater and talk nonsense or are you going to come in?
VJs, keep entertaining, hit like.
This isn't like other movies, it's just "Salt and Pepper."
We need to fight and win... Great punch... Killing trailer, dudes.
Die-hard fan of Chiyaan Vikram.
Trailer filled with excitement. The movie might be great.
Review of "Nerkonda Parvai" by Blue Sattai Maran.
Waiting for the next bigil movie.
The trailer looks amazing, talented filmmaker Lokesh Ganagaraj.
Encouraged everyone to watch the movie in theaters, but someone spoiled it by pirating it online. Don't mess with Thala's anger, he won't spare those who indulge in piracy.
The Malayalam movie "Chindhamani Kolakes" copied Ajit's style.
This THALA movie looks intense like never before.
Rajini is back to his youthful vigor. Thalaiva's charisma is overpowering. 
I can't believe he's 69.
What's with this, it looks like a Telugu movie, not Tamil!
Thala... Thala... Thala... Thala... Thala... Thala...
Vijay fans expressed their dislike, but they're just jealous. Go and cry to your mother.
It's a blockbuster but not on the level of Bahubali 2.
Why are there so many dislikes? What's wrong with them?
Fans of Thalaivar, hit the like button if you think he's got mass appeal.
Watch it a hundred times and hit like.
Can't wait to see Thala's performance on the big screen.
Do I look like a small boy to you? Even if you say so, I won't be bothered!
#Die hard fans of #Ajithkumar, hit like.
We need to see more of Sethupathi anna's mass. There's still more potential in his acting.
Thalaivar is still ruling the hearts, he won't let us down.
Why are you doubting Siva's capabilities after Viswasam? Thala's climax was extraordinary.
Hey, what's this? Are you trying to turn "Kaithi" into "Con Air" with your piracy, Lokesh?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A remake of "Pink," a classy movie.
Zero is better, hit like if you agree.
Amazing... The VFX they've done is incredible. Thala's dialogue delivery... next level.
Thala is at the top of his game.
You've added Viswasam's BGM in the background, haven't you?
Brother, at least release it in Hindi a month later.
This isn't a movie (they're making a fool of us), it's just news. Thala looks unimpressive.
In Kerala, Tamil actors' star value: 1. Vijay, 2. Surya, 3. Rajani, 4. Vikram, 5. Dhanush, 6. Vijay Sethupathi, then Ajith.
I thought it was Manju Warrier, but it's Anushka.
They've shown the whole film in just one building and one field... lol.
Dhanush's swag is just awesome. We need to learn from him how to carry ourselves.
Shankar sir is an example; he showed that it's possible to achieve Hollywood standards in Tamil cinema.
Thalapathy fans are excited for Lokesh Kanakaraj's movie #THALAPATHY64.
Nothing happens randomly, everything happens according to Thala's will.
I am a fan of Jayam Ravi anna.
Thala's look... extraordinary... Nice BGM... U1 is superb... The movie is superb...
"Petta" is fantastic. "Muni 4" and "Kanchana 3" motion posters are released.
Hey Karthik Subbaraj, you should know you're a superstar, buddy.
You're great! From a Vijay fan.
The movie is definitely going to hit the bullseye
Your acting is ultimate; your dialogue delivery is unmatched.
The first trailer seemed silly, but this one looks amazing
This looks like a vada chennai trailer
Is Pandey making a cameo in the film? That'd be cool.
You have to wait longer to know who I am
Go, convey the message to the boss!!! .... Run
The roar of the whistle is electrifying... This is called 'verithanam
I am a fan of Thalapathy, but I watch it slowly 100 times... but the likes and views are very low.
Love you, Dhanush anna, you're awesome!
The BGM from 0.38 to 0.58 is on another level.
Thala, the time has passed, my eyes are burning. Tomorrow I will come and see you. Thala, I love you.
The trailer is awesome, it's mass!
It's not important who gets the likes; what's important is the box office. Only the leader can hit there.
Is this also a family movie like 'Kadaikutty Singam'?
It's impossible to miss the National Award at this time.
Thalaivar is on fire... You'll see amazing events like never before from now on.
I love the movie 'Crime Side'. Hoping it will be like 'Ratchasan'
Greetings of art to everyone, Angali Pangali.
Adithya Varma and Kadaram Kondan are both not matching, but both are doing well. Who will watch the video first daily, father or son, is a doubt
Hey, they're disliking it, watch it a bit and then put it up.
After watching 'Petta' more than 10 times, please like it.
Teejay fans, like here! I love Teejay songs.
Wow, it's on another level! I'm eagerly waiting.
"Kaithi audience response. Please subscribe.
Thalaivaa... Love your words, wow!
One should not cast doubt on another's trust. What a great dialogue!
Thala's every dialogue delivery is awesome, on another level, Goosebumps overloaded.
It's surprising that 'Viswasam' didn't have such an opening, still only 10 million. 'Viswasam' trailer reached 14 million in one day. Something seems to be missing.
You don't work for me, you work for Yeman. Only one dialogue is enough, Chiyaan (Vikram) is life.
Superstar, the king of kings forever
Nivetha looks good in the suit... But Rashi doesn't look good.
All of that is his actions, portraying a movie
Kabali and Kaala are liked by everyone
Like it, share it in your WhatsApp group
If it had come during Diwali, it would have been good. Instead, it's just a flop that made money.
If there's Rajni sir, nothing else is needed.
Surya annan is my life & Karthi annan is my support.
If I have to say it simply, the trailer is absolutely mass. What acting by the person!
Ner Konda Parvai.. Is the title suitable for Thala?
Who all agree that Vijay Sethupathi cannot set this kind of dance?
It seems like a remake of the movie Pink.
Support Nakeeran Kopal in the Pollachi matter.
Congratulations for 'Kaithi' and all the best for 'T-64'.
views from 19.2k to 12M
As long as Thalaivar is in the movie, it's always going to be superb
This Super Star is all we need, he's the favorite of 90's kids.
In Kochadaiiyaan, there's a scene with football. It's shown in one of the trailers
At 1:40, what Harris Jayaraj's BGM is playing? It's actually Yuvan Shankar Raja's BGM.
The Sarkar teaser record is safe. We uploaded the Telugu teaser and Hindi teaser, you won't be able to catch up
"Vada Chennai 2" is going to be just as entertaining.
So much excitement... It's overwhelming... it's packed with punches... this trailer is on another level.
In the climax of "Asuran," if Arjun had modified Dhanush's dialogue and said it, it would've been amazing.
The VFX is outstanding, just killing it.
Thalaiva, you're beyond amazing, boss, and you're the epitome of mass.
Cool to see the old Rajini returning.
Superstar fans from Kerala, like here.
We need to give a lot, a lot, a lot of support.
Lots of love from Karnataka. Hit like for Karthi fans.
Will it hit 1 million likes? Hit here.
Age is just a number for him... just for fun... Thalaivar is masssss...
Age is just a number for him... just for fun... Thalaivar is masssss...
Such a waste, the trailer is terrible. It's a disgrace to Ajith fans.
Hey Ajith, you dog, if you keep making films like this, you'll end up like Kamal Hassan, disappearing without a trace.
Only those who rely on mere buildup and BGM can't create hits... unless it's a movie like this given by Vetrimaran sir... Hats off... Dhanush sir's acting... worth to watch...
You look like a little boy trying to imitate someone. How true?
Any Yuvan Shankar Raja fans here?
Thala, Thala, mass fan from Karnataka.
Thalaiva, a big fan from Kerala.
Thalaivaaaaaa, you're like a god. Proud to be your fan.
Next time, those who look at the trailer with envy, comment because we bring glory to our trailer. If they had talent, they would have been on our side.
We're waiting for someone, wondering what he's up to.
Why are you jumping around like you've got a laddu in your hand while watching the trailer? Will Pink movie also turn out like this someday?
"Petta" is better than "Viswasam" (same old story like "Veeram").
It's been a while since we saw Prakash Raj...
Ajit as a lawyer for the first time.
A lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot.
The trailer is outstanding. There are no words to describe the stunts.
Thalaivaaa... that dance at the end was superb.
The trailer looks good... But it doesn't match up to Siva's standards.
Why is Thalaivar's trailer trending so much after a long time?
I like this trailer. When will it be released in Hindi?
Yuvan's BGM is amazing... It's been a long time, and I'm very happy that Thala has collaborated with him...
I am a fan of Chiyaan Vikram sir... But I love Ajith Kumar sir...
1.46 looks like a bigil football stadiumIt resembles a Bigil football stadium at 1:46.
I'm from Telangana, long live Rajini, long live Thalaiva. 
Watch the Aaluma doluma song and give it a like.
No matter how many films Dhanush-Vetrimaaran makes, they are heaven for cinema lovers.
Ajith's last word is always superb.
Only Dhanush's fans should like.
Pink movie will be more enjoyable... reason - THALA...
SK Anna's mass, I like you Anna, eagerly waiting.
When the trailer is amazing, the movie will be eagerly awaited.
WHO IS BADLY WAITING FOR THIS MOVIE?
Ajith fans, like here for Kaithi.
1:56 Thalaivar's dialogue is on another level.
Fans of the Chindamani Kolacase movie, hit like here.
I think people should support at least this superhero movie... SK at his utmost best... always mass.
Vikram, I love you.

1:06 Gibran is on another level.
"The lion might have a wound but it won't let go of its pride."

Thala, Thala, he's the only Thala of Tamil Nadu. 
Waiting to see the real version of the Vekkai novel.
Super mass movie... love you Thalaivar.
1 million likes haven't come yet, all Thala fans, hit like.
If someone tries to surpass me, I'll show them my power. Thala's powerful dialogue.
The movie might be average, but it might be a hit for Ajith.
Everything is alright, but the trailer is not good.
1.37 "you need to wait more to understand me!!.."
If a lion roars, it doesn't mean it's not a lion anymore.
Anna, you're on another level, I'm eagerly waiting.
This is the truth... This is real excitement...
Superstar and Shankar's combination is always solid...
For 43 years, he hasn't given a chance for his enemies to breathe.
Come on dude, come in dude.
Pink remake, not good in Tamil. Thala, come bravely for Diwali.
Our Thala always has swag that no one can match.
Never put your phone in airplane mode.
Mass... The way Thalaivar handles it is like catching a small child. Same style, same Rajini.
Enough, cowardice is gone. Just 10 more days for 10M views.
The last scene with the black dress... wow, what a chance!
Did you get it? It's the Pink movie.
Just leave, we are discussing. We are sweet talking.
This is a Rajini movie... this is a Rajini movie.
Many many many... Our Thala who ignites the excitement... Wow, he's got amazing energy.
If the trailer is like this, can't wait for SAAHO, won't even need to borrow cash.
Absolutely, the trailer is superb, excellent.
Dhanush Anna's fans, hit like.
We'll talk sweetly, then we'll eat sugar without any worries.
We'll talk sweetly, then we'll eat sugar without any worries.

One person's faith above all is mass Thala.
Hey boys, come here, let's talk about cinema and stuff.
Hey Ghibran, how do you come up with such awesome background music?
Marana waiting for you, Thalaiva.
Simran looks young even with Trisha. Wow.
For Thalapathy fans, give Dhanush a like.

Thalaiva, until Pongal, this is enough.
Let's make it 8 million views.
Hey, what's this? You're making 'Kaithi' look like 'Con Air'? 
Hit like if you spot Mahat at 0:13 
Those who say this is a milestone in Ajith sir's career, comment.
Thala's level is superb, love you so much, Thala.
I am waiting for this movie.
90% of the comments are just asking for likes... so irritating 
Thangam, what you said is right, goodbye.
Please dub this into Kannada. The trailer is very good. Jai Hindustan.
Even with age, his style remains unique. Hats off, Thalaiva.
Hey, isn't this the movie 'Velayudham'? Why are you confusing us?
Those who watch Thalaivar's movie on the first day, hit like.
Everything is okay except for the background music, it's somewhere else.
After hearing this, the craving for this meal has increased.
There was a group... when the movie flopped, they were hiding... now they're coming out a bit.
Even if Seenu tries too hard, he can't become like Thalapathy.
This is rubbish, all this to make a movie? We need to hit them hard.
Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi fans, hit the like button first.
Hit, slap, poke, before anyone else... #Trending #1....
What should we do now? Let's eat something sweet.
90s kids love Vijay Sethupathi.
It's definitely going to flop... everyone just inflate it like a balloon.
This movie is surely going to be awesome, Thalaivar rocks.
Great job, Ghibran.
I'm a fan of Vijay Anna. It's amazing. Thala sir is superb.
The last dialogue is okay, but the trailer seems staged.
380k views and 200k likes, awesome.

Wow, Thala. Goosebumps. Can't wait to watch.
Petta is releasing on January 10th, eagerly waiting, Thalaiva.
People who don't like Ajith sir will dislike, even if the movie is good.
Kalyani's lip sync is off, do you agree?
Oh no, waiting is getting unbearable... when will this movie release... Thalaivar is the best.
At 1:05, Thalaivar wow... put in the 'Padayappa' dialogue here... those who understand, hit like... First Day First Show.
They're going all out with their enthusiasm, making others feel inferior.
Watching Shankar sir's trailer feels like watching an Avengers trailer; it's on a Hollywood level, superooo super, sir, no words, it's on another level.
Thalaiva is superb. Hats off to Shankar sir and the 2.0 team.
Even before the movie releases, it's already got 2.5 million likes, 40 million views, and 200k comments.
Tomorrow, we'll be watching Thala... eagerly waiting... for Thalapathy fans.
This is going to be a blockbuster... mark my words.
Honestly, it's unbelievable how much energy they have at this age.
How to draw Kaithi Karthi?
Get ready for some fantastic events this Pongal... Thalaivar's arrival will be epic...
Please turn on the hotspot, I can't watch the trailer, the internet is too slow.
